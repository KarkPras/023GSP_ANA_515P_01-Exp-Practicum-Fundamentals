**Results**  
**Demographics: Descriptive Statistics**  
1. The initial comprehension and cleaning of the three demographic variables—age, gender, and country—have been completed. Here is a  summary:  
2. There are 27 survey questions and 1259 records in the survey. We have 1251 useful records for further research after deleting 8 records of outliers (meaningless age).  
3. The subjects are 32 years old on average. Based on the employment seniority, we divide the age variable into four categories: fresh (16–24), junior (25–34), senior (35–60), and super (above 60). The distribution of subjects among the four age groups is as follows: freshmen (12.47%), juniors (56.51%), seniors (30.70%), and seniors (0.32%).  
4. The poll shows a very diverse representation of gender recognition. We group the reported gender into five basic categories: cisgender (both genders are present), transgender (both genders are present), genderqueer, and intersex. 19.74% of the respondents are cis-female, 78.82% are cis-male, 1.04% are genderqueer, 0.32% are transgender, and 0.08% are transgender men.  
5. The participants are from 46 different countries. US, UK, and Canada are the top three countries. To show the location of the 1251 useful subjects globally, we generate a heat map.  
6. There are 724 large companies, 233 medium and 284 small companies
